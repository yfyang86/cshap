Description: The 'spams' package provides an R interface to the SPArse
    Modeling Software (SPAMS) library, an optimization toolbox for
    solving various sparse estimation problems. Dictionary
    learning and matrix factorization (NMF, sparse PCA, ...).
    Solving sparse decomposition problems with LARS, coordinate
    descent, OMP, SOMP, proximal methods. Solving structured sparse
    decomposition problems (l1/l2, l1/linf, sparse group lasso,
    tree-structured regularization, structured sparsity with
    overlapping groups,...).
